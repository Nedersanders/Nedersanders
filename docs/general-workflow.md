- **Shared Resources**: Templates, brand guidelines, and reusable assets
- **Archives**: Previous versions and completed project materials
- **Infra / Architecture**: Files related to project design

## üìã Project Management

### Trello Integration
[Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/68865fecc1f9daeb3ba66922/ATTI1ab34ffc0cff4b6b747dff9d00e05327C685CD46)

- **Main Board**: All project tasks are managed through our Trello board. We have 2 boards, one for development, and one for design.
- **Special tickets**: Some tickets are not for issues / features, but for resource allocation, ideas, suggestions, etc. This will make sense by reading the column name.

### Ticket Lifecycle
1. **Content Ideas / Room for improvement** ‚Üí Ideas and future enhancements
2. **Next up** ‚Üí Issues / Features that will be planned in the near future
3. **Current Sprint** ‚Üí Planned to be worked on. Move tickets from here to **In Progress** 
3. **In Progress** ‚Üí Currently being worked on, or **On hold** ‚Üí Something we will get back to later.
5. **Done** ‚Üí Completed and deployed
6. **Junk drawer** ‚Üí Discarded ideas

## üé® Design Sprint Process

### Planning Phase
- **Stakeholder Input**: Gather ideas from all Sanders in the global chat or design group
- **Wireframing / Design**: Create low-fidelity layouts before implementation
- **Design Review**: Approve designs before development begins, lets get the opinion of multiple sanders.


## üåø Branch Strategy

### Naming Convention
All branches must follow this structure:
```
dev-[name]-[whatyouaredoing]
```

### Examples
- `dev-sanderslagman-navbar-redesign`
- `dev-sanderverschoor-contact-form-validation`
- `dev-sandermetdelangeachternaam-mobile-responsiveness`
- `dev-sandersander-easter-egg-feature`
- `dev-sandernotxander-performance-optimization`

### Branch Types
- **Feature branches**: `dev-[name]-[feature-description]`
- **Bug fixes**: `dev-[name]-fix-[bug-description]`
- **Improvements**: `dev-[name]-improve-[what-you-improve]`
- **Experiments**: `dev-[name]-experiment-[what-you-test]`

### Branch Workflow
1. **Create** branch from `main`
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b dev-yourname-feature-description
   ```

2. **Work** on your feature
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Test your changes locally

3. **Push** regularly
   ```bash
   git push origin dev-yourname-feature-description
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Link to relevant Trello ticket
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Request review from team members

5. **Merge** after approval
   - Squash commits if needed
   - Delete branch after merge

## üí° Suggestions & Ideas

### Suggestion Process
1. **Create Trello Card** in "Ideas/Suggestions" list
2. **Add Details**: 
   - Clear description of the suggestion
   - Implementation or design complexity estimate
   - Any relevant mockups or examples

3. **Team Discussion**:
   - Weekly review of new suggestions
   - Prioritize based on impact and effort
   - Move approved suggestions to Next-Up

4. **Implementation**:
   - Assign to team member
   - Create development branch or design
   - Follow normal workflow

### Types of Suggestions
- **UI/UX Improvements**
- **Performance Optimizations**
- **New Features**
- **Different approaches**


## üîß Development Guidelines
